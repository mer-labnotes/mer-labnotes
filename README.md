A constantly evolving scientist, exploring the power of data to transform science. Welcome to my profile!

## ðŸ§  About me

I am a biologist specializing in Advanced Biotechnology. I have participated in research projects in the health field, studying the bioactivity of natural compounds with potential therapeutic applications, and also in agriculture, analyzing how abiotic stress affects different rice varieties.
Through these experiences, I discovered the value of data and the usefulness of digital tools to improve and streamline scientific work. Since then, I have been training in programming as a way to enhance my skills and approach problems from a more creative perspective.

## âœ¨ What motivates me?

I'm inspired by curiosity, a constant desire to learn, and the ability to apply knowledge to create real change. I believe in the power of data to reveal patterns, better understand problems, and propose more informed solutions. I'm especially motivated by the idea of â€‹â€‹building bridges between science and technology, combining the two to create useful, sustainable, and impactful tools.

I'm also driven by collaboration: learning from others, sharing what I know, and being part of a community that supports and evolves together. For me, knowledge is not only power, but also a form of connection and collective transformation.

## ðŸŽ¯ My goal

My goal is to continue developing a hybrid and multidisciplinary approach, combining science with digital tools to create impactful solutions. At the same time, I want to grow within a community that innovates, shares, and collaborates to move forward together.
